# Data cleaning of global mass layoff dataset
Project aimed to test what kind of exploratory analysis we can do using just SQL. 

Back in 2023 when I joined my first startup as a product manager, I was given the task to conduct exploratory analysis of our user data to find inights which could be used to create new products or improve our GTM strategy. We had a database on MySQL which was connected to Mixpanel. Although Mixpanel was our choice of analysis tool, it would have taken me time to adopt and learn it and I wanted to start right away and deliver fast. Therefore, I made this project to test till what extent I can use SQL to conduct analysis as it is easier to learn compared to other tools. I also learnt Mixpanel side-by-side and eventually started using both down the line.


For my sample data I have used the Worldwide Company Layoff dataset. It consists of data related to company such as name, location, industry , No. of employees laid off, percentage of employees laid off etc.
I have used basic SQL functions without making it too complicated as we already had an analyst for more complicated anlytics.

The project is divided into two parts
1. Data Cleaning - I try to clean and standardize the data set, eliminating any duplicates or null values.
2. EDA ( exploratory data analysis)- I explore the data set to look for particular insights.

At the end i present a small report.

This project ended up becoming a capstone project as part of the training for interns joining our product team.
